web application for hierarchical tree visualization  of the employees :

As specified in given image generic.png (inititial hierarchy)
**If It does not look pretty please minimise your screen size **

like if we add more than 3 people under NED than 4th or 5th child comes under his grandchild which does not look pretty so just press control key and scroll down , hierarchy will look prety.

By default Ned is already registered with : 
  user ID : Ned
  password : admin
for other users register them first then use that, there is a link for registeration in login box , right lower side.

When Ned logins himself via given credentials then he can Log Out as well as add new people under him 
and there is a black border around his card which shows who is logged in as specified in specific.png
